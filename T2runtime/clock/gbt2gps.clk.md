## GBT (TEMPO2 converted from TEMPO)

Green Bank Telescope clock corrections (TEMPO2 converted version)

This file is automativally converted from the TEMPO-format GBT
clock corrections, which are obtained directly from the observatory.
Thus these can be expected to be fully up to date. Please see the
GBT clock corrections file entry for further details.

If questions arise about the original data, contact Ryan S. Lynch
