# UTC(GPS) UTC(GPST)
# This clock file provides support for corrections to 'GPS' in a relatively
# backwards compatible way.
# Specifically, tempo2 gps2utc.clk used to correct to GPST for a period, then
# correct to the UTC as derived using the corrections to get a good approximation of
# UTC from the GPS time.
# (In either case, no leap seconds are added)
