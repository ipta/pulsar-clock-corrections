## UT1 table

UT1 table

This file records the Earth's actual rotation in the form of
corrections TAI-UT1 in a format readable by TEMPO.

This file is generated from Astropy's parsing of the IERS
bulletins. It should be updated approximately monthly, and it
includes the IERS predictions covering about a year after the
publication date.

This differs slightly from the version traditionally distributed
with TEMPO - that is generated by a combination of a perl script
parsing the output from the IERS web form and a custom C program
generating predictions. As a result, this generated file may not
extend as far into the future as the conventional ut1.dat does.
There are also minor differences in some of the early values; the
origin of these early values is not completely clear, and some of
them predate the earliest values in the IERS bulletins Astropy uses.
