Parkes observatory clock corrections

This file is pulled from the Parkes observatory repository and should 
be up-to-date.

The comments read:

    Tie of Parkes clock to GPS time standard. Sources are listed below.
    Where two clock systems existed simultaneously, the dates refer to
    periods when the given clock was supplied as the observatory 1 PPS

    (before this, clock was tied to Tidbinbilla clock: see pks2tid.clk)
    MJD 50844    - 52311.17     Mark IV clock vs Totally Accurate Clock (GPS)
                                  from: update_clkcorr -t pksgps4 gps??.dat
    MJD 52311.17 - now          Mark VI clock vs GPS East
                                  from: update_clkcorr -t pksgps6 pkclk00.*

The file includes a first entry on MJD 0.00521 with a clock
correction of 1.04 us; while normally we automatically ignore MJD 0
for plotting purposes, this value must be in there for a reason so
we retain it.
