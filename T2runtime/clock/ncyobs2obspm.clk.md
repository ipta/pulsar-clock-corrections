Nancay-related clock corrections?

This file is pulled from the TEMPO2 repository and may not be fully
up-to-date.

The European Pulsar Timing Array maintains an internal repository
of clock corrections, which they have transferred to the TEMPO2
repository, so  EPTA telescope data in the TEMPO2 repository (and
thus here) can be expected to be somewhat up to date.

Leading comments from clock file:

    # Data after MJD 57006.0 are corrected for the polynomial fit to the GTR-50 receiver drift.
    # Data after MJD 58000.0 are such that clk correction + obspm2gps = 0.
