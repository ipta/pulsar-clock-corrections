FAST clock correction file

This file is pulled from the PINT repository and may not be fully up-to-date.
(TEMPO doesn't seem to have this file at all.)

The original file is currently hand-generated upon request, but it is
planned to make the process automatic and the file downloadable (at
which point we will make it update automatically here).

If you have any questions about these clock corrections, the person
to contact is 缪晨晨 <miaocc@bao.ac.cn>, Chenchen Miao.
