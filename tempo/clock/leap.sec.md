## Leap seconds

Leap seconds table

This file lists the MJDs of leap seconds, starting from 41499.
The format can only accommodate positive leap seconds (but all
leap seconds so far have been positive).

This file is generated from Astropy's parsing of the IERS
bulletins. It should be updated at least six months in advance
of any planned leap second (and not otherwise).
