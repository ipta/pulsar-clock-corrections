"""Tools for downloading and parsing BIPM data.

BIPM Circular T records the differences between UTC inferred from GPS and
actual GPS. It has changed format and content a number of times, and it has had
errata published, but the issued Circular T values do not change. As a result
it can make sense to use updated summary tables published by the BIPM. There
are also two different ways to infer UTC from GPS, and the BIPM has published
two different versions (C0 and C0').
